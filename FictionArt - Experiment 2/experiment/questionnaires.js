                        We are interested in the way you can imagine and visualize scenes in your mind. For this task you will be presented with <strong>four scenarios</strong>. For each one, try to <strong>form a mental picture</strong> of the people, objects, or setting. 
                        If you do not have a visual image, rate vividness as <strong>'1'</strong>. Only use <strong>'5'</strong>, for images that are as lively and vivid as real seeing.
